A PID Controller for optimizing the movement of a satellite in a 3D space (with a bit of "machine learning" to determine optimal gain values). Used as a learning project. Software used :: Trick (https://github.com/nasa/trick), Blender (https://www.blender.org/), and Linux (I use Ubuntu 18.04 for my distro).
